## MATLAB Exercises for the needs of the "Structure and Electrical Properties of Materials" course

Structure and Electrical Properties of Materials is a 2nd Semester course of the school of ECE at NTUA. During this course, studying the properties and behaviour of semiconductors,
we had to complete 3 exercises using MATLAB:

-Exercise 1: Diagram of density of states (N) and Electric field (E)<br />
-Exercise 2: Diagram of density of energy states (n) and Temperature (T)<br />
-Exercise 3: Diagram of Mobility () and doping concentration (Nd or Na)<br />

Except of the 3 code files, there is also a lab report written in Greek.
